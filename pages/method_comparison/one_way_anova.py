        st.markdown("""ANOVA, which stands for **Analysis of Variance**, is a statistical method used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.
        \n ANOVA is most easily explained by the concept of "value-splitting". ANOVA divides the observed data values into components whihc are attributable to the different levels of factors. 
        \n In a **one-way ANOVA**, the analysis is performed using a single independent variable (or factor), such as QC level (e.g., QC1, QC2, QC3), and examines how this factor influences a continuous dependent variable (e.g., analyte concentration). A one-way layout consists of a single factor with several levels and multiple observations. The mean of hte observations within each level of the factor is calculated, and the residuals will then give us an idea of the variation observed at each level.

        \n The core idea is to compare the **variation between groups** to the **variation within groups**. If the variation between groups is significantly larger than the variation within groups, it suggests that the group means are not all the same.

        \n - **Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: At least one group mean is different.

        \n The result is quantified using a **p-value**. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a statistically significant difference between groups.
        \n In this app, we will use one-way ANOVA to assess the differences in analyte concentrations across different QC levels. This can help identify potential analytical stability issues or QC performance drift.
        \n If you want to assess how multiple factors may affect more than one factor, consider ANOVA with a wider pull, such as: **Two-Way Crossed ANOVA**, **Two-Way Nested ANOVA**, or **Multi-Way ANOVA**.

        1. **Upload your CSV file**  
        - Click the ‚Äúüì§ Upload CSV File‚Äù button.
        - Make sure your file is in **CSV format** and contains one row per sample.
        - Required columns:
            - `Material`: Identifies the QC level (e.g., QC1, QC2, etc.)
            - `Analyser`: The instrument used (optional, but useful for filtering)
            - `Sample ID`: Unique identifier for each sample
            - One or more **analyte columns** with numeric values

        2. **Data Check**  
        - Once uploaded, the app shows a **preview of your data**.
        - The analysis will focus only on samples where the `Material` column starts with ‚ÄúQC‚Äù (e.g., QC1, QC2).
        - Missing analyte values will be automatically excluded from the analysis.

        3. **Select Analyte**  
        - From the dropdown menu, choose the analyte you want to assess.

        4. **View ANOVA Results**  
        - If at least two QC levels are present, the app performs a one-way ANOVA.
        - The output includes:
            - üìä An ANOVA summary table
            - üìà A violin plot showing data distribution by QC level
            - ‚úÖ Interpretation of the **p-value**

        5. **Interpret Your Results**  
        - A **p-value < 0.05** suggests a statistically significant difference between at least two QC levels.
        - Use this to evaluate analytical stability or QC performance drift.

        üìù *Tip:* For best results, ensure your dataset has sufficient QC replicates (at least 3 per level) to support reliable analysis.
        üìù *Tip:* To compare results between different lot numbers, make sure to include this detail within your data. If there is not data available in your dataframe, it will skip this step.
