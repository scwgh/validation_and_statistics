        st.markdown("""ANOVA, which stands for **Analysis of Variance**, is a statistical method used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.

        In a **one-way ANOVA**, the analysis is performed using a single independent variable (or factor), such as QC level (e.g., QC1, QC2, QC3), and examines how this factor influences a continuous dependent variable (e.g., analyte concentration).

        The core idea is to compare the **variation between groups** to the **variation within groups**. If the variation between groups is significantly larger than the variation within groups, it suggests that the group means are not all the same.

        - **Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: All group means are equal.
        - **Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: At least one group mean is different.

        The result is quantified using a **p-value**. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a statistically significant difference between groups.
        In the context of laboratory quality control, ANOVA helps determine if there is a **statistical difference in measured values across different QC materials**. 
        For example:
        - Is the concentration of a certain analyte measured consistently across QC1, QC2, and QC3?
        - Are results from different runs or batches statistically distinguishable?

        Using ANOVA allows you to:
        - Detect systematic shifts or drifts in QC levels.
        - Verify consistency and stability in analytical performance.
        - Support method validation or troubleshooting by quantifying variability.

        This app simplifies the process by allowing you to upload your results, select an analyte, and instantly see whether there's a significant difference in concentration between QC levels.

        1. **Upload your CSV file**  
        - Click the ‚Äúüì§ Upload CSV File‚Äù button.
        - Make sure your file is in **CSV format** and contains one row per sample.
        - Required columns:
            - `Material`: Identifies the QC level (e.g., QC1, QC2, etc.)
            - `Analyser`: The instrument used (optional, but useful for filtering)
            - `Sample ID`: Unique identifier for each sample
            - One or more **analyte columns** with numeric values

        2. **Data Check**  
        - Once uploaded, the app shows a **preview of your data**.
        - The analysis will focus only on samples where the `Material` column starts with ‚ÄúQC‚Äù (e.g., QC1, QC2).
        - Missing analyte values will be automatically excluded from the analysis.

        3. **Select Analyte**  
        - From the dropdown menu, choose the analyte you want to assess.

        4. **View ANOVA Results**  
        - If at least two QC levels are present, the app performs a one-way ANOVA.
        - The output includes:
            - üìä An ANOVA summary table
            - üìà A violin plot showing data distribution by QC level
            - ‚úÖ Interpretation of the **p-value**

        5. **Interpret Your Results**  
        - A **p-value < 0.05** suggests a statistically significant difference between at least two QC levels.
        - Use this to evaluate analytical stability or QC performance drift.

        üìù *Tip:* For best results, ensure your dataset has sufficient QC replicates (at least 3 per level) to support reliable analysis.
        üìù *Tip:* To compare results between different lot numbers, make sure to include this detail within your data. If there is not data available in your dataframe, it will skip this step.
