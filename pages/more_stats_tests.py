    This section provides additional statistical tests commonly used in laboratory validation and verification analysis.
    Use the buttons below to launch the test you're interested in.
    \n **Disclaimer**: This section is **in development** and some of the features below may be prone to error. The following buttons are NOT ACTIVE and are prone to error: Anderson-Darling, Bartlett, Cochran, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kruskal-Wallis and Levene's Test.

    Understanding which statistical test is most appropriate for your data is sometimes a bit of a maze. This module incorporates a number of different statistical tests which are suitable for verification, validation, linearity adn 
    - **Anderson-Darling Test** â€“ Determine if a sample of data comes from a specific distribution. 
    - **Bartlett's Test** â€“ Assesses the equality of variances across multiple groups. It is sensitive to departures from normality and should only be used when data is approximately normally distributed.
    - **Chi-Squared Test** â€“ Tests the independence of categorical variables or compares observed vs expected frequencies. Commonly used with contingency tables to assess distribution fit.
    - **Cochran's Test** â€“ Used to detect whether a single variance is significantly larger than others in a group. Useful for identifying outliers in precision studies.
    - **CUSUM Test** â€“ A sequential analysis technique for detecting small shifts in process mean over time. Helpful in ongoing quality control to monitor consistency.
    - **F-test** â€“ Compares the variances of two populations. Commonly used to determine if two methods have significantly different variability.
    - **Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov Test** â€“ A non-parametric test that compares a sample distribution with a reference probability distribution (e.g., normal) or compares two sample distributions.
    - **Kruskal-Wallis Test** â€“ A non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA for comparing medians of more than two independent groups. Useful when data does not meet ANOVA assumptions.
    - **Levene's Test** â€“ Tests the equality of variances across groups. Less sensitive to non-normality than Bartlett's test, making it a robust option in many real-world datasets.
    - **Mann-Whitney U Test** â€“ A non-parametric test for comparing differences between two independent groups when the data is not normally distributed. It compares median values rather than means.
    - **P-P Plots** â€“ Graphical tools to assess if a dataset follows a specified distribution (e.g., normal). Points should fall along the reference line if the data is normally distributed.
    - **Q-Q Plots** â€“ Graphical tools to assess if a dataset follows a specified distribution (e.g., normal). Points should fall along the reference line if the data is normally distributed.
    - **Shapiro-Wilk Test** â€“ Tests whether a sample comes from a normally distributed population. Often used as a preliminary check before performing parametric tests.
    - **T-test** â€“ Compares the means of two independent groups to determine if they are significantly different. Assumes normally distributed data with equal variances.
    - **Total Allowable Error** â€“ Evaluates whether the total observed error in a method is within acceptable clinical or regulatory limits. Integrates both bias and imprecision.
    - **Z-test** â€“ Tests whether a sample mean differs significantly from a known population mean. Suitable when population variance is known or sample size is large.
