    This app provides a comprehensive platform for performing various validation and verification analyses in laboratory settings. 
    Each section allows you to upload your data using the templates, explore outputs and export results as needed.

    #### 📂 Templates and Data Upload
    - For each module, you can upload your data in CSV format. Ensure your data is structured correctly according to the provided templates.
    - 3 templates are provided:

        - Imprecision and Method Comparison data ( QC, EQA and Patient data)
        - Linearity and Calibration data
        - Limits (LOB, LOD and LOQ) data
    \n For each module, your data must be in CSV format. Ensure your data is structured according to the provided templates. 
    \n It is important that column names (i.e., Date, Material, Analyser, Sample ID) are consistent with the templates to ensure proper analysis. 
    \n You may insert as many analyte names as required - however, avoid introducing spaces or special characters **(e.g., @ : ; ! , . # < >)** in the column names.
